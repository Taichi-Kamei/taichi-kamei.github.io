# Arch Linux Experience

## Why I tried Arch

- Used Xubuntu for Autonomous Clue Detect Robot comp
- Was familiar with Git, Nix command from robot summer and clue detect robot
- Had refurbished Thinkpad I used for the course
- Had time during winter break though setting arch was done the day after my last final exam
- Wanted to use Hyprland and ppl said hyprland with Arch is well documented

## What I learned

- Not as bad as I initially thought
	- Probably because I was used to git/nix command and had vague understanding in linux architecture
- Storage Partition
- fdisk
- WPA enterprise (Eduroam, other school wifi) is so heinous. most of the problem was this
- You have to install Sudo yourself!!
- I can now say I use arch btw
- Everything can be customized and its fun but also comes with risk


# Hyprland Experience

- Kitty is goated
- Bind Key and tiling manager are so much better than mac or windows
- Waybar was pain to set
- Learned css just to customize waybar. That's why I have a pretty decent portfolio
